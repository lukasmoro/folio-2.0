    "text": "Building helps one to gain clarity about the nature of a new idea. When designing things through making the actions of sketching and prototyping are applied: \"Sketches contribute back to its creator, while prototypes radiate outward to the others and the world\". * \n \n Early on sketches help to gain understanding about the materiality of the given technology. ** They provoke a conversation with the material because of their interactive nature. This process derives smaller problems inhabiting the bigger idea. It also refines and concretises the initial idea, which retrospectively often is exposed as more of a vague direction. After showing sketches to stakeholders, prototypes can fuse insights of the sketches into interactive artefacts for precise communication. Flexibility in trajectory on the final interventions is important up to the latest point to exploit the maximum insight from the building process. When clarity of mind is reached early prototypes provide a solid foundation to build more refined prototypes for outside communication. \n\n This quote by Stappers summarises the applied process for designing interactions well: \"Functional artefacts are where ideas touch-down on earth, stop being theory and start becoming reality.\" ***",
