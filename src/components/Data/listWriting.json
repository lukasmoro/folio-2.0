    "text": "48 hours is little time. A hackathon is about building sh*t quick. Heavy load on the network. Many talanted people in a room. Deciding on a clear vision early is key. Getting to know your team-mates in the process is beautiful. Version control is at the core of working independently. Make sure to understand your code. I failed at working modular. Thanks to my teammates and the organisers.",

    "text": "Physical co-location of humans leads to non-verbal data exchange between people about their surroundings. Software experienced through non-spatial outlets creates presence isolated from our physical surroundings. Multi-player games, communication- and collaborative platforms are connecting people. This happens in an abstracted space. Co-located mixed reality changes this. It allows for direct experience and manipulation of virtual objects from different perspectives in the same physical space. This enhances the meaning of those objects through perceiving the response of others to them. Togetherness* in mixed reality removes scenarios of isolation and emphasises exchange and collaboration between people. Its value should be considered when designing spatial experiences.",

    "text": "Building helps one to gain clarity about the nature of a new idea. When designing things through making the actions of sketching and prototyping are applied: \"Sketches contribute back to its creator, while prototypes radiate outward to the others and the world\".\n\nEarly on sketches help to gain understanding about the materiality of the given technology. They provoke a conversation with the material because of their interactive nature. This process derives smaller problems inhabiting the bigger idea. It also refines and concretises the initial idea, which retrospectively often is exposed as more of a vague direction. After showing sketches to stakeholders, prototypes can fuse insights of the sketches into interactive artefacts for precise communication. Flexibility in trajectory on the final interventions is important up to the latest point to exploit the maximum insight from the building process. When clarity of mind is reached early prototypes provide a solid foundation to build more refined prototypes for outside communication.\n\nThis quote by Stappers summarises the applied process for designing interactions well: \"Functional artefacts are where ideas touch-down on earth, stop being theory and start becoming reality.\"",
